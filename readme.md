# Geometry

Let's practice your's object-oriented programming skills.

## Prerequisites

-   Javascript
-   Object-oriented programming

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
1.  Go inside the folder you just cloned.
1.  Create a web file structure.
1.  Open VScode.
1.  In your `index.html` file, add a HTML boilerplate `HTML:5`.
1.  Wire up yours `script.js`and `style.css` files to the HTML.
1.  Go to your `script.js` file and add a console.log, i.e: `console.log("script file is linked")`.
1.  Open the file `index.html` in your brownser, and open your console (**command** + **option** + **i**)
1.  You should be able to see your message in the console.log, if you are not seeing your message go to step 5 and review your steps from there. 
1.  Submit your work by creating a new pull request.

## Rectangle

Declare a **`Rectangle`** class. where the constructor should take a `length` and `width` as arguments.

The Rectangle class should have the following methods...
* **`isSquare`** - This method returns **`true`** if the rectangle is a square, otherwise returns **`false`**
> Hint: Squares have sides of equal length.

* **`area`** - This method returns the area of the rectangle.
> Hint: Area = length * width

* **`perimeter`** - This method returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
> Hint: Calculate the perimeter by adding all of the sides together.

Instantiate 2 rectangles with different lengths and widths.
For each rectangle you instatiated, print the following messages:
**The area of the Rectangle is \____**.

**The perimeter of the Rectangle is \____**.

**This Rectangle is a square!** (if the return of method **`isSquare`** is true).

**This Rectangle is NOT a square!** (if the return of method **`isSquare`** is false)

## Triangle

Declare a **`Triangle`** class. Where the constructor should take three sides -- `sideA` `sideB` and `sideC` -- as arguments.

The Triangle class should have the following methods...
* **`isEquilateral`** - This method returns **`true`** if the triangle is equilateral, otherwise returns **`false`**.
> Hint: Equilateral triangles have sides of the same length.

* **`isIsosceles`** - This method returns **`true`** if the triangle is isosceles, otherwise returns **`false`**.
> Hint: Isosceles triangles have two equal sides.

* **`area`** - This method returns the area of the Triangle.
> Hint: A triangle has three sides represented by `a`, `b` and `c`, as well as a semi-perimeter, represented by `s`. `s = (a + b + c)/2` and Area is equal to the square root of `s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)`.

* **`isObtuse`** - This method returns **`true`** if the triangle is obtuse, otherwise returns **`false`**.


Instantiate 3 Triangles. each one with different values from each other.
For each rectangle you instatiated, print the following messages:

**The area of the Triangle is \____**.

Add other messages to test your code :+1:

## Shape

Define a `Shape` class. It should have the number of sides and a color associated with it. Make the other classes inherit from it.
